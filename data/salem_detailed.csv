Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?

We've got loads of flowers here. Over the years, Tom has planted apple and cherry trees, a plum tree, a fig tree, rhubarb, herbs and tomatoes, and a big berry patch full of blackberries, raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and currants. We like to call it ""Tom's Berry Farm"" but it isn't really a farm - though we sometimes joke that we could probably open up a roadside stand with all the produce.

Family is the most important thing to us and we enjoy spending time with our kids and grand kids. Other interests include cooking, reading, salmon fishing and volunteering for local charities like the Marion County Food Bank and Assistance League.

Five years ago, the travel bug hit me, and I spent six months in Thailand, before venturing throughout the United States and then spending another three months in Thailand, Cambodia and Malaysia. I grew up on Air Force bases in Alaska, California, Florida, Washington, Oregon and the Philippine Islands.

I want to open up my home so that others can experience an authentic travel experience while visiting Oregon, a truly beautiful state, if I do say so myself!  Salem is the capitol of Oregon and approximately 45 miles south of our beloved Portland and an hour from our stunning coast.

PORCELAIN SINK: The kitchen sink is porcelain so take care with glass, which can shatter if banged or dropped in the sink. (We understand accidents happen so please inform us. Our cleaning team will need to know.) KEEP KITCHEN CLEAN: Dirty dishes or open food left on the counter may attract tiny harmless ants. Please rinse dishes and load them in the dishwasher as soon as possible. FOOD: We will discard any open condiments or used food after you check out, so please buy in small quantities. We provide single serving packets of basic condiments. RECYCLE: Please help us recycle. Instructions are in the House Manual. LAWN SERVICE AND GARBAGE: You may see and hear the lawn service on Tuesday afternoons.  ","Bus stops are just a 4-minute walk. Buses go directly downtown to Salem’s main bus depot. Uber and Lyft are also available if you need a taxi. If you’re driving, you’ll have quick, easy access to Interstate 5 (I-5) (2 miles from the house).  If you want to explore the region, the coast is just an hour directly west. The city of Portland with its famous International Rose Garden and the Columbia Gorge with its many waterfalls are both an hour north. Mt. Hood and Mt. St. Helens are further but worth the drive. Wineries dot the area and in the spring you can visit many flower gardens (iris, dahlia, peony, rose, tulip). Willamette Valley is also known for its U-Pick berry farms. From June to Labor Day, the Salem Volcanoes’ professional baseball team (single-A) play their home games just 15 minutes north on I-5.

If issues or questions arise during your stay please notify them immediately so that that the problem can be addressed as soon as possible.,"AirBNB requires that guests read and agree to the House Rules before making a reservation. We want you to have a stress-free stay in our home so we feel it’s important that we share our expectations up front so there will be no misunderstandings.  Keep in mind our home is not a hotel nor is it owned by AirBNB; this is our private home containing our personal possessions. Thank you for taking time to read all the rules. A copy of the House Rules will be sent to you again before you book.  CITY TAX:  You will see an automatic charge on your reservation for taxes. This includes a 9% City of Salem Occupancy Tax plus a 1.8% State of Oregon Lodging Tax. 30+ DAYS LEASE: If you are staying for more than 30 days, we require that you sign a formal rental agreement. However you won't need to pay the 9% City of Salem Occupancy Tax. 30+ DAYS CLEANING: Bi-weekly cleaning is included in the cost. You are required to allow the housekeeper access to the house on those days.

Most recently, I have enjoyed “packing down” my bike with gear and heading down the road - for an overnight, or three, or three weeks.  This gives a whole new meaning to “bed and breakfast”.

When I’m not cycling, I’m usually busy cooking, cleaning, reading, sewing or watching the trees and flowers grow in my little forest; and, of course, accommodating the many fascinating guests who find their way to Century House from all corners of the globe.  My life is truly enriched by the diversity of perspectives and experiences that guests bring with them.

I confess, my favorite guests may be the children. With a full career of working in the field of early childhood, I never cease to be wowed by the uninhibited enthusiasm, curiosity, and resilience of the younger generation.  I am thrilled and dedicated to being a family-friendly business.

Another of my endeavors is the promotion/education of good nutrition.  I might be seen pedaling to a local farm to fill my packs with broccoli for the local food bank  - or, with fresh kale for a morning smoothie :-).  Don’t worry, there is still room for a brownie or an oatmeal cookie on the dessert tray.  After all, we need our dark chocolate, and our oatmeal, right?
